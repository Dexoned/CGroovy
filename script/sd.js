                    To be young and in love in New York City
                    To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
                    To be drunk and in love in New York City
                    Midnight into morning coffee

                    One that I had never lived
                    Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
                    And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
                    Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again
